<h2>CVS Repository</h2>

When CVS refers to a repository, it is referring to a complete
CVS collection on the CVS server. This includes the CVSROOT
directory, which contains the administrative files, and is the
root directory of the entire CVS tree.

<p>
Your CVS server system administrator will provide you with this path name.
