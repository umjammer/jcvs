<h2>CVS Modules</h2>

When CVS refers to a module, it is referring to a <i>subtree</i>
of the CVS <a href="repos.html">repository.</a> The module can
also be a definition in the CVSROOT/modules file that defines
a set of directories and/or files that consitute a module.

<p>
When you specify a module name in jCVS, the slash character, '/',
is used for the name separator, no matter what operating system
you are running the client on. For example, the module name for
the jCVS source code is 'ice/java/com/ice/jcvsii'.

<p>
If you wish to checkout the entire repository, you can use the
module name '.'. HOWEVER, please be sure that you understand
what checking out the entire repository implies. For instance,
the Giant Java Tree repository checkout requires 20MB of disk space.
