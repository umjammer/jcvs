jCVS - Global Preferences

<h2>Global Preferences</h2>

Global preferences are those that apply to operations that are
not part of another subsystem, or that apply to many instances
of the preference throughout the application.


<dl>

<dt><b>GZIP File Mode</b>
	<dd>
	Whether or not GZIP compression is allowed to be used for file transfers.
	Set this property to false if you get complaints from the server that
	state something like "couldn't exec gzip".
	If you are not sure if you should use this setting, leave it set to 'False'.
	<p>
<dt><b>GZIP Stream Level</b>
	<dd>
	This determines the level of compression used to compress the protocol
	stream. The level should a value from 0 to 9. If you set the level to
	zero, compression is disabled. If you set the level to 9, you get maximum
	compression. Level 6 is a reasonable default if you used compression.
	This compression is much preferrable to 'GZIP File Compression", as this
	method compresses the entire protocol stream, not just the files transferred.
	<p>
<dt><b>Load Servers</b>
	<dd>
	Whether the default CVS server definitions should be loaded.
	Set this to 'False' if you no longer want the default servers listed
	with your own server definitions.
	<p>
<dt><b>Log File</b>
	<dd>
	The path of the file to use for CVSLog logging.
	CVSLog is used for logging protocol traces and other
	debugging information.
	If you do not specify a path in the name, the file will
	be created in the current directory.
	<p>
<dt><b>RSH Command</b>
	<dd>
	This setting defines the path to the rsh command.
	If you are using jCVS under UNIX, the internal rsh implementation will not
	work because it will no be able to create a 'priveleged' socket (512-1024).
	If you are running on Windows or Macintosh, set this path to an empty string
	to use jCVS's internal RSH implementation.
	If you are running on UNIX, set this path to the location of your rsh command,
	which is typically "/usr/bin/rsh".

<dt><b>Server Commands</b>
	<dd>
	This setting defines the server command used to invoke the cvs program.
	For each hostname in the first column of the table, the corresponding value
	in the second column of the table will be used as the command used to invoke
	the cvs program on the server.
	Please note this only applies to the 'Server' connection method.
	Use the hostname "DEFAULT" to define a default command for hosts that do
	not have server commands defined explicitly.
	<p>
<dt><b>Temp Directory</b>
	<dd>
	The temporary directory used during CVS operations.
	<p>
<dt><b>Trace Protocol</b>
	<dd>
	Sets the 'global' CVS protocol tracing flags.
	If you select 'Trace Protocol', then all CVS commands will
	log all of the CVS protocol to your log file. This will assist
	in efforts to debug jCVS operation.
	<p>
<dt><b>User Ignores</b>
	<dd>
	This CVS ignore specification will be added to the default CVS
	ignore specification. For instance, Java programmers might add
	'*.class' here to ignore compiled class files.
