<h2>Selecting jCVS Projects</h2>

A jCVS project is the same thing as a CVS local working directory.
When you checkout a CVS module, you create a working copy of the
source code on your local disk. You work with the local copy of the files.

<p>
There are times when jCVS needs you to identify one of these local
working directories, or projects. Unfortunately, the original FileDialog
provided by Java does not allow you to select a Folder. Therefore, jCVS
needs to have you select a file that clearly identifies the project that
you are interested in. To do this, it has you select the 'Entries' file
that is located in the 'CVS' administrative directory that is at the top
leve of the project that you are identifying.

<p>
When you are presented with the FileDialog, navigate to the top level
directory of the local working directory. Then open the 'CVS' directory
in that top level directory. Then select the 'Entries' file inside
the 'CVS' directory and 'Open' the file.
