jCVS - Create Panel
</title>

</head>


<body>

<h2>Create Panel</h2>

The Create panel is used to create new modules on the server.
What this really means is that you can use this panel to create
new directories in the cvs repository.

<h2>Access Method and Login</h2>
Like all of the panels that allow you
to access the CVS server, the top of the panel describes
the access and login information. This
<a href="../misc/cmnlogin.html">
common access and login input area
</a>
determines how you access the server. You will need
to get the information from the CVS system administrator.

<h2>Checkout Parameters</h2>

The checkout command requires a number of parameters to properly
check out the source that you require. These parameters are specified
in the text fields below the login area. These fields are detailed
in the following table.
