jCVS - Server Definitions

<h2>Server Definitions</h2>

Server definitions allow jCVS to predefine the parameters needed to
access a particular CVS server. The user can then select a predefined
server definition in any of the command panels to have the server's
information entered automatically.

<p>
JCVS includes a number of default server definitions. The user may
also add their own server definitions by creating a server definitions
file in their home directory (which is printed on stdout during startup
as the 'user.home' property). This file will be named '.jcvsdef' on
systems which use '/' as their file separator character (typically
UNIX systems), and 'jcvsdef.txt' on all other systems including the
MacOS and Windows.

<h2>Server Definitions File Format</h2>

The format of the server definitions file is based upon the Java properties
file format. This means that all properties are defined using the 'name=value'
syntax.

<p>
Each server definition is started by defining a property prefixed by 'server.'.
The name that follows the prefix is considered the 'server definition name'.
The property's value is a boolean which determines if the definition is actually
presented to the user. Setting the value to false allows you to hide definitions
from the user without deleting the definition. For example,
<br><center><code>
server.gjt=true
</code></center>
<br>
defines a server definition named 'gjt', and indicates that the server
definition should be presented to the user.

<p>
Once you define a server definition, you must then define a number of
properties for the definition. Each property is defined using a property
name constructed using the syntax 'param.servername.propertyname=value'.
For example, the host property for the 'gjt' server would be defined
using:
<br><center><code>
param.gjt.host=cvs.gjt.org
</code></center>
<br>

<p>
The following table lists the parameters that must be defined for a
complete server definition.

<dl>

<dt><b>method</b>
	<dd>
	The connection method. Set to 'server' or 'pserver'.
	<p>
<dt><b>name</b>
	<dd>
	The displayed name of the server definition.
	<p>
<dt><b>module</b>
	<dd>
	The module name of the definition.
	<p>
<dt><b>host</b>
	<dd>
	The hostname of the CVS server.
	<p>
<dt><b>user</b>
	<dd>
	The login name for this definition.
<dt><b>repos</b>
	<dd>
	The CVS repository, or root, directory.
	<p>
<dt><b>desc</b>
	<dd>
	A more complete description of the server definition.
	<p>

</dl>

<h2>Example</h2>

The following is an example definition which defines the CVS
server for anonymous access of the Giant Java Tree project.

<pre>
<code>
server.gjt=true
param.gjt.method=pserver
param.gjt.name=Giant Java Tree
param.gjt.module=java
param.gjt.host=cvs.gjt.org
param.gjt.user=anoncvs
param.gjt.repos=/gjt/cvsroot
param.gjt.desc=\
This is the root of the Giant Java Tree. \
Use the password 'anoncvs'.
</code>
