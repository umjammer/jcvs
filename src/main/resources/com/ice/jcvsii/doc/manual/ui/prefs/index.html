<h2>jCVS Preferences</h2>

In order to deal with the diverse environments in which it operates,
as well as make the UI as pleasant and efficient as possible, jCVS
provides a large number of configurable preferences.

<p>
In previous releases of jCVS, the only way to configure these preferences
was to edit a text file that contained Java property definitions. This
was complicated and error prone. As of the 5.0 release of jCVS, all
configuration can be done via the Preferences Editor GUI, with the sole
exception of the
<a href="../misc/serverdefs.html">
server definitions,
</a>
which will get a configuration UI in a later release.

<p>
The preference configuration is stored in your
<a href="../misc/rcfile.html">
jCVS rc file
</a>
as a Java properties file. This file is written everytime jCVS exits
so that it can remember all of your settings for the next time you
launch. It even remembers window positions and column widths.

<p>
Another new addition in release 5.0 is <i>project preferences.</i>
In other words, some preferences are set on a per project basis.
In order to accomodate this, jCVS creates a preferences file in
the 'CVS' admin directory alongside the standard CVS admin files.
This file is named 'jcvs.txt'. It stores preferences such as the
project's window size and location, and other preferences that
apply specifically to a project.
