<h2>Advanced Preferences</h2>

<dl>

<dt><b>CVS Timezone</b>
	<dd>
	WARNING Changing this setting may cause jCVS to not work properly.
	This is the CVS Timezone. This setting determines what timezone is
	used to establish a zero offset from GMT. CVS uses GMT+00 for
	all timestamp comparisons. This will affect how CVS decides if
	files have been modified.
	The only reason to change this setting is if your JVM does not
	consider the timezone "GMT" as GMT+00 (which is a bug). For example
	JVM's from Sun prior to release 1.1.4 require this setting to be "GMT+00".
	<p>
<dt><b>Checkout Command</b>
	<dd>
	The Checkout CVS command specification.
	WARNING Changing this setting may cause checkouts to not work properly.
	This is the CVS Command Specification string that determines the
	way that new projects are checked out. \n\nIt is not recommended that
	you change this setting unless you know exactly what you are doing.
	Refer to the "CVSCommandSpec.html" documentation for further details.
	<p>
<dt><b>Debug CVSProject</b>
	<dd>
	This setting allows you to turn on extensive debugging that will
	assist in debugging project handling. This should only be true
	when you are interested in a log that can help debug a jCVS problem.
	<p>
<dt><b>Debug EntryIO</b>
	<dd>
	This setting allows you to turn on extensive debugging that will
	assist in debugging CVS administration file IO. This should only be true
	when you are interested in a log that can help debug a jCVS problem.
	<p>
<dt><b>Ignore Filename</b>
	<dd>
	The local CVS ignore filename.
	By default, CVS reads files named '.cvsignore' for a list of files
	that should be ignored during processing. Unfortunately, some operating
	systems do not allow filenames to begin with a period. If you enter
	a filename for this property, then files with that name will be checked
	for ignore specification anytime there are found in a directory. Set this
	to the empty string to use only '.cvsignore'.
