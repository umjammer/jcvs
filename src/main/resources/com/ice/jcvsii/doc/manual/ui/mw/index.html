<h2>jCVS Main Window</h2>

The jCVS Main Window presents the major parts of the user interface.
Each of these parts is displayed in a panel in the tabbed main panel.

<p>
When you think of CVS commands within jCVS, you should think in terms
of two categories: those that operate on a checked out working directory,
and those that don't. For instance, commands that operate on a checked
out working directory include status, tag, diff, and update. Checkout,
export, and import are commands that do not operate on working
directories.

<p>
Commands that operate on working directories are run via the project
Window. Commands that do not, are all run via the main window, since
there is not working directory to be displayed in a project window.
