<h2>Work Bench Panel</h2>

The work bench panel is designed to help you organize your
CVS projects, and make accessing them easier.

<p>
The work bench allows you to define any number of folders,
which are nothing but an abstract container in which you can
place other folders or CVS projects. When add a folder into
another folder, you will get a nested folder, just like with
directories on the file system. When you add a project to the
work bench, you will be able to open the project by double
clicking on its icon. You will also be presented with the
project's details whenever you select it.

<h2>Adding Folders</h2>

Adding a new folder to the work bench is a two step process.
First, select the folder that you wish the new folder to be
placed inside of. Second, click the "Create New Folder" icon:<b>
<center>

</center>

<p>
You will then be presented with a dialog box asking you for
details about the new folder. These details include a "Brief Name",
and "Display Name", and a "Description". <b>NOTE</b> that the
brief name <b>must</b> be unique amoung all of the folders
inside the same folder. This is what jCVS uses to tell the
folders apart. You will note that the field is filled in with
a funny looking value for you. You are encouraged to just
leave that value there, since it is guarenteed to be unique,
and you will never see the name anyway.

<h2>Adding Projects</h2>

Adding a new project to the work bench is also a two step process.
First, select the folder that you wish the new project to be
placed inside of. Second, click the "Add New Project" icon:<b>
<center>
<img src="../../../images/wbnewprojecticon.gif">
</center>

<p>
You will then be presented with a FileDialog requesting that you
select the Entries file for the project you wish to add. This is
the same method of
<a href="../misc/selectproject.html">
selecting jCVS projects
</a>
that is used throughout jCVS.

<p>
Again, you will be presented with a dialog box requesting details
about the project you are adding to the work bench. Again, the
Brief Name must be unique, and you are encouraged to leave it
set to the default that was filled in for you automatically.
