jCVS - Preferences

<h2>Preferences</h2>

While jCVS continues to use text file containing Java properties
to store configuration information, you should no longer need to
edit these by hand. Instead, you will now use the
<a href="edit.html">
GUI based preferences editor
</a>
for that purpose. The only exception to this rule is the Server
Definitions that must be editted by hand currently.
