# jCVS

jCVS is a Java based CVS Client. CVS is a source code control
system based on RCS. One primary benefit of CVS is that	it
provides a server/client protocol which allows clients such
as jCVS to be written. JCVS allows any Java1.1 capable machine
to be a CVS client, providing for a totally distributed source
code management system.

We are approaching the 21st century, and I know of few machines
left on the planet that do not have a web browser. Therefore,
please kindly open the file 'README.html' in the 'doc' folder
to continue with the documentation experience.
