<h2>Action Preferences</h2>

<dl>

<dt><b>Use JAF</b>
	<dd>
	Determines whether or not the Java Activation Foundation (JAF) is used for.
	driving the action verbs.
	Set this preference to true if you wish to use JAF. This will cause 
	jCVS to use JAF to drive action verbs such as open and edit. JAF
	requires that you properly setup the mime types and mailcap files.
	Set this preference to false if you do not wish to use JAF. This is 
	the default, as most people do not like to setup their mime and mailcap
	files. If you are having problems getting your file to open when you
	double click on it, try setting this to false.
	<p>
<dt><b>Verb Commands</b>
	<dd>
	The ExecViewer's verb command map.
	Each item in the combo box is an 'ext . verb' combination.
	Each item has a command line and an environment string.
	The command line is a standard argument string. The variable
	'$FILE' will be expanded to the full pathname of the file
	being acted upon. The variable '$CWD' will be expanded to
	the current working directory.
	The environment string is a string of 'key=value' environment
	settings that will be passed into the command being exec-ed. If
	this field is left empty, exec will be invoked with an environment
	which will cause exec to pass in your shell environment.
	You may define default verbs using '._DEF_.verb' definitions to
	handle extensions \ that are not defined, or files that have no
	extension.
	You can handle specific files with no extention, for instance 'Makefile',
	by defining '.Makefile.verb'.
