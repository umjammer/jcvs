<h2>Test Panel</h2>

The Test panel is used to test the connection with a CVS server.
The purpose of this panel is to reduce the complexity of the
connection test and provide detailed feedback on the protocol
to help debug problems connecting to a CVS server. If you are
having difficulty connecting to your CVS server, you should
attempt to connect using this panel, since it will give you
feedback in the text area on how the protocol progressed.

<h2>Access Method and Login</h2>
Like all of the panels that allow you
to access the CVS server, the top of the panel describes
the access and login information. This
<a href="../misc/cmnlogin.html">
common access and login input area
</a>
determines how you access the server. You will need
to get the information from the CVS system administrator.

<h2>Checkout Parameters</h2>

The checkout command requires a number of parameters to properly
check out the source that you require. These parameters are specified
in the text fields below the login area. These fields are detailed
in the following table.

<table border=2>

<tr>
<td>CVS Server</td>
<td>
This is the hostname of the CVS server.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>CVS Repository</td>
<td>
This is the full path name of the repository you wish to
access. The path is the root of the cvs repository.
</td>
</tr>

</table>
