jCVS - Project Window Files
</title>

</head>


<body>

<h2>Project Window Files</h2>

The project window prensents you with a tree oriented view
of the files in your working directory. Unlike CVS, jCVS shows
you <i>only</i> the files that are a part of the CVS repository.
It completely ignores files that are not checked in.

<p>
The columns of the file view can be resized by clicking the mouse
on the small divider between the column headers, and dragging the
mouse to resize the two columns straddling the divider.

<p>
Shift clicking extends the current selection, and control clicking
toggles the selection.

<p>
Right clicking (windows) on a file or directory icon will present a context
sensitive popup menu that will allow you to run commands directly,
instead of having to select the file and then select the command
from the Selection menu.
