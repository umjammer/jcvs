<h2>Export Panel</h2>

The Export Panel is what you use to export a module
from a CVS Server to a local disk. Export is typically
used to create a release that will be imported by another
CVS site. It is also used to export the source files for
a specific release build.

<h2>Access Method and Login</h2>
Like all of the panels that allow you
to access the CVS server, the top of the panel describes
the access and login information. This
<a href="../misc/cmnlogin.html">
common access and login input area
</a>
determines how you access the server. You will need
to get the information from the CVS system administrator.

<h2>Export Parameters</h2>

The export command requires a number of parameters to properly
export the files that you require. These parameters are specified
in the text fields below the login area. These fields are detailed
in the following table.
