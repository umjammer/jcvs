jCVS - Project Window Arguments

<h2>Project Window Arguments</h2>

At the top of the projct window, above the file tree, and below
the menu bar, is a text input field in which you enter arguments
for the CVS commands that you wish to execute.

<p>

<p>
Because jCVS was designed to be configured by properties, and 
thus did not define "fixed" commands, jCVS requires that you
enter all arguments on the command line. A future version of
jCVS may offer a UI that provides for fixed commands, and
would thus provide dialogs to collect the specific arguments
for each command.

<p>
For example, if you were running the <i>diff</i> command, you
would need to specify the revisions that you wished to diff.
The arguments input field is where you would enter them. Thus,
you might enter "-r1.2 -r1.3" in the arguments field, and then
run the 'diff' command.

<p>
Once a command is run, the arguments field is cleared so that
you do not accidentally reuse the arguments in the next command
that you run.
