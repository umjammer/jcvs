<h2>CVS Ignore Spec</h2>

There are many times during the operation of CVS that you
wish to <i>ignore</i> certain files. For instance, if you
were about to import your latest Java servlet, you would
not wish to have the class files imported along with the
source files.

<p>
To accomodate this problem, CVS defines <i>ignore specs</i>
which describe files that are to be ignored. The ignore
specs work much like the old "globbing" expressions used
by some shells.

<p>
Ignore specs match file names, but they allow for two wildcard
characters. The character '*' will match any number of any characters,
and the '?' character will match any single character.

<p>
Ignore specs are separated by spaces. This is a problem for
developers that allow spaces in their filenames.

<h2>Examples</h2>

Here are some examples of CVS ignore specs.

<table border=1>

<tr>
<td>
*.class *.txt *.jar
</td>
<td>
This is a common ignore spec used by Java developers. It will
ignore all class files, all JAR files, and text files. Thus,
all of the following files would be ignored: Main.class,
Utility.class, app.jar, notes.txt, stackTrace.txt.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
*.o *.a core *.so
<td>
This is a common ignore spec used by C developers. It will
ignore all object files, library files, shared library files,
and core files.
</td>
</tr>
