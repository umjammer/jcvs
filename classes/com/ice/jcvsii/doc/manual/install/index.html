<h2>jCVS Installation</h2>

Installing jCVS is like any other Java application. You will extract
the contents of the jCVS archive into a location, and point your CLASSPATH
to the jcvs.jar file in that location.

<p>
When you unpackage the jCVS archive, you will find an application
directory, in which the jcvs.jar file is located. You will find a doc
directory containing the documentation. If you downloaded the source
archive, you will also fine a directory named source that contains
everything you need to reproduce the binaries included in this release.
