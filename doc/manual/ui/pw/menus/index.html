<h2>Project Window Menus</h2>

Because the jCVS Project Window menus can be configured via the
properties file, there is only one menu that is guarenteed to
be displayed - the File menu.

<p>
The default configuration of jCVS adds four addition menus to
the project window - Project, Selection, Monitor, and Misc.
