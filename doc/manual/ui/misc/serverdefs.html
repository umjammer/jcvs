<h2>Server Definitions</h2>

JCVS provides for server definitions that allow you to instantly
fill in many of the parameters in the main window panels. Any
place that you see the 'Servers...' button,<br>
<img src="../../../images/serverdefsbtn.gif"><br>
you can access these
server definitions.

<p>
When you click on the 'Servers...' button, you will be presented
with the dialog box shown below. Select the server you wish to
connect to, and click the Ok button, and as many fields as possible
will be filled in with the parameters that describe the repository
defined by the selected server definition.
