<h2>Preferences Editor</h2>

The new preferences editor in jCVS II will be familiar to
anyone who has used the preferences editor in Netscape's Navigator.
Most modern applications are moving to this new style of editting
preferences.

<p>
When you select the 'Edit Preferences...' menu command from the
'File' menu on the main window, you will be presented with a 
dialog box with two panels. The panel on the left presents
a hierarchical view of the various settings you can edit.
The panel on the right will display the editor for a specific
preference when that preference is selected in the tree on
the left.

<p>
When you edit preferences, your modifications are not committed
until you select the "Save" button at the bottom right of the
dialog box. If you select the "Cancel" button <b>all</b> of your
modifications will be lost and the previous preferences will be
left untouched.
