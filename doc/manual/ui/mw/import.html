jCVS - Import Panel

<h2>Import Panel</h2>

The Import Panel is what you use to import a vendor export
into the CVS repository. It is also a good way to add a
large number of new files to a module.

<h2>Access Method and Login</h2>
Like all of the panels that allow you
to access the CVS server, the top of the panel describes
the access and login information. This
<a href="../misc/cmnlogin.html">
common access and login input area
</a>
determines how you access the server. You will need
to get the information from the CVS system administrator.

<h2>Connection Parameters</h2>

The import command requires a number of parameters to properly
import files properly. These parameters are specified in the
text fields below the login area. These fields are detailed
in the following table.

<table border=2>

<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>CVS Module</td>
<td>
This is the <i>path name</i> that identifies the CVS module
that you wish to checkout from the server. This can be either
a module alias, or a pathname to an actual module.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>CVS Server</td>
<td>
This is the hostname of the CVS server.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>CVS Repository</td>
<td>
This is the full path name of the repository you wish to
access. The path is the root of the cvs repository.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Import Directory</td>
<td>
This is the <b>full</b> pathname of the local import directory.
The imported files will be read from this directory. If you
checked the Import SubDirectories checkbox in the Additional
panel, then all subdirectories in the subdirectories will be
imported, as will their subdirectories.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Arguments</td>
<td>
Place any arguments for the CVS import command in this field.
</td>
</tr>

</table>

<h2>Additional Parameters</h2>

The import command allows for so many parameters, that a
second panel was required to allow you to enter them.
These fields are mostly text fields, which require a lot
of screen space. These fields are detailed
in the following table.

<table border=2>

<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Import Subdirectories</td>
<td>
If checked, subdirectories will also be imported. Otherwise,
only the files in the import directory will be imported, and
subdirectories will be ignored.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Vendor Tag</td>
<td>
The vendor tag that will be applied to the import branch.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Release Tag</td>
<td>
The release tag that will be applied to the imported files.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Log Message</td>
<td>
The log message that will be recorded with the imported
files.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Ignores</td>
<td>
This is a
<a href="../../misc/ignorespec.html">
CVS ignore spec
</a>
that identifies files that should be ignored and not imported.
The specs in this field will be added to the default ignore spec.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Binary Files</td>
<td>
This field is another "ignore spec", except that in this case
every file that matches the spec will be treated as a BINARY
file, and imported into the repository with the '-kb' flag.
This allows you to check in both text and binary files in
one operation. CVS users will recognize this as a feature
provided by cvswrappers.
