<h2>Macintosh Installation</h2>

I do not know what is necessary to install under the MacOS
(which is very sad, if you know my history). If anyone out
there would like to improve this page, please feel free to
send email.

<h2>Files</h2>

Your jCVS files, such as your preferences, will most likely
be created in the System Folder. I do not know where your
home directory will be located. Both of these will be printed
on the stdout when you launch jCVS. Your preferences file will be
named "jcvsii.txt". Your server definitions file will be named
"jcvsdef.txt".
