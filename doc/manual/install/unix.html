<h2>UNIX Installation</h2>

Installation under UNIX is as simple as extracting the contents of the
distribution archive into the directory of your choice. The archive is
built in a fashion that separates the executable files from the source
files. However, you are free to place any of the files anywhere you
choose. The only file you need to run jCVS is the jcvs.jar file, which
can be placed anywhere since it is pointed to by your CLASSPATH.

<h2>Files</h2>

Your jCVS files, such as your preferences, will
be created in your home directory. Your preferences file will be
named "~/.jcvsii". Your server definitions file will be named
"~/.jcvsdef".
