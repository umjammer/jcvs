<h2>Install AnyWhere Installation</h2>

If you install jCVS using the Install Anywhere installer, then all
system dependencies should have been managed by the installer program.

<h2>Files</h2>

You might be interested to know that the installer creates a file
name "____.lax", which has properties that you might be interested
in setting. The file has comments in it. The file is located in the
directory in which you installed jCVS.
