<h2>Editting Preferences</h2>

Editting preferences in jCVS II is now simple and GUI based.
You now use a preferences editor much like the one found in
Netscape Navigator and other applications.

<p>
To edit the preferences, select the 'Edit Preferences...'
menu item in the 'File' menu in the main window.

<p>
The preferences are organized into several categories:

<ul>

<li><a href="actions.html">
	Actions</a> - preferences related to file actions, like double clicking to edit.
	<p>
<li><a href="adv.html">
	Advanced</a> - preferences you should rarely need to configure.
	<p>
<li><a href="global.html">
	Global</a> - preferences that apply to global aspects of the application.
	<p>
<li><a href="pw.html">
	Project</a> Window - preferences that control the project winow.
	<p>
<li><a href="wb.html">
	Work Bench</a> - preferences that control the work bench panel in the main winow.
	<p>
</ul>
